I just needed a really simple cheatsheet.
Couldn't really find anything, so I made one myself in plain HTML/CSS/JS.

A live version is available at https://barbeque-squared.github.io/snowrunner-cheatsheet/.

Sources:
- icons: white from the game (license unknown, but Sabre please don't hate me for using them here kthx), black is just the grayscale channel inverted
- tyre info: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ehuLHwbmA5ktr0ZC_gv52H3fkz3qxJY_i_uS7Gh0xRU/edit

Everything else is mostly just ingame information or some other personal notes.
This isn't a complete walkthrough, it just makes certain information less annoying to look up.

In terms of license:
- see the above explicitly mentioned sources
- for everything else, probably MIT so you can't blatantly copy it and claim it as your own. Additionally, you can't make money off it. Basically: feel free to share it among friends, but I better not see this in some monetized walkthrough. A non-monetized walkthrough with credit is fine though.

# Development
The files in the `regions` folder deliberately have weird extensions.
Because they are actually valid HTML, so editors will work with it, we just happen to interpret them as Javascript.
