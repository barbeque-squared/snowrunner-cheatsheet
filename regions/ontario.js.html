<b>Notes on Water</b>
<ul>
  <li>There are Water Booms and Water Stations</li>
  <li><em>Both</em> of these are also sometimes referred to as Water Towers</li>
  <li>
    Water <b>Booms</b> are mostly useless, but the following are interconnected:
    <ul>
      <li>The Flooded Lands 1-2</li>
      <li>The Flooded Lands 3-4</li>
      <li>Burned Forest 5-6-7</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Water <b>Station</b> are the infinite water sources you want to use</li>
  <li>
    The one you want to restore is the one on The Flooded Lands directly next to the road, near the initially locked tunnel.
    The contract for this one is Fire Department / Restoring the Water Tower 2.
